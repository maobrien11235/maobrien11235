- 👋 Hi, I’m @maobrien11235 or Matt O. to my friends. 
- 👀 I’m interested in continuing to use data science to answer questions that I find interesting. I've built models, data pipelines, visualizations,
and software at Fortune500 companies, and I'm always interested in adding to my skills.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning survival analysis and regression methods to answer a question about a fashion model's likelihood to win a contest
in America's Next Top Model. Working title is America's Next top (Nerdiest) Model, more to come in this repo.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on not much at the moment. I want to contribute to statsmodels and other econometric and data analysis libraries, but I'm
looking to get my own coding house in order before I try to submit bad code.
